# PROJECT PLAN

## Overview
This project aims to allow users to track their nutritional intake and supplements effectively.

## User Input
Users will enter current prescribed doses for supplements, not daily diaries. They will be able to:
- Specify different quantities for family members taking the same supplement.
- Track costs associated with the supplements.

## Nutrition Data Review
It will also include functionality for manual review of nutrition data to ensure accuracy and personalization.
